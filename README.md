# detection-net

## Problem Statement
Do you need to detect when a person is in a room but, for whatever reason, can't track them with a camera? This project aims to use a handful of simple sensors (temperature, CO2, light, and humidity) and some neural nets (from TensorFlow's framework) to predict the presence of a human without such a camera.

I'm not sure when you would have the processing power to run a neural net but not the processing power to run a camera peripheral but this project seemed like a good way to learn more about TensorFlow.
